## Description

WiShare is an offline file-sharing application designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. It allows users to transfer files seamlessly between PCs over WiFi without an internet connection.

## Getting Started

To run the application in development, you'll need the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - A JavaScript Runtime environment
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - A fast, secure and reliable package manager for Node.js
- [Rust v1.70 or greater](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A language empowering everyone
  to build reliable and efficient software.

In addition, this project uses Tauri v1.3, see [prerequisite](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) for your operating system.

Once you have the dependencies installed, clone the project and install the required packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opeolluwa/wi-share.git wi-share
cd wi-share # navigate to the cloned directory
yarn install # install the dependencies
yarn tauri dev # run the application locally

```
